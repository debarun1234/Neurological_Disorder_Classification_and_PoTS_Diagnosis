# Neurological Disorder Classification and PoTS Diagnosis

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script for classifying neurological disorders and diagnosing Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS) using machine learning techniques. The code includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and two classification models: logistic regression and a neural network. It is designed to help healthcare professionals and researchers in the field of neurological disorders to analyze and classify patient data effectively.

## Features

- **Classification of Neurological Disorders**: This part of the code utilizes logistic regression to classify neurological disorders based on input data. It provides insights into identifying patients with specific neurological conditions.

- **Classification of PoTS using Neural Networks**: The code employs a neural network to classify PoTS based on input data. It includes ROC curve plotting and diagnosis statements, which can aid in the diagnosis of this condition.

## Installation and Usage

To use this code, follow the installation instructions in the README, place your data files in the specified directory, and execute the script. The code will perform data preprocessing, model training, and classification. Detailed results, including confusion matrices, classification reports, ROC curves, and diagnosis statements, will be displayed in the console.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Set up a Python virtual environment (recommended) and install the required dependencies.

3. Place your CSV data files in a designated directory and update the `file_path` variable in the `main()` function with the path to your data directory.

4. Run the script to analyze and classify neurological disorders and diagnose PoTS in your dataset.
